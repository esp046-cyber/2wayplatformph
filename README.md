# 2wayplatformph
2-way platform instruction guide builder for:
Target Users:
Developers working on multi-platform projects (iOS/Android, Frontend/Backend, Client/Server)
Technical writers documenting parallel workflows
DevOps teams maintaining deployment guides for different environments
Educators teaching comparative platform development
Project managers coordinating cross-platform teams
What It Does:
Creates side-by-side instruction guides showing how to accomplish the same goal on two different platforms simultaneously.
Key Use Cases:
Mobile development: Compare iOS vs Android implementation steps
Web development: Frontend vs Backend setup instructions
API integration: Client-side vs Server-side configuration
Migration guides: Old system vs New system procedures
Multi-environment: Development vs Production deployment
Why It's Useful:
Prevents confusion - See both platforms at once, spot differences
Saves time - No switching between separate documents
Shows relationships - Cross-references link related steps
Tracks progress - Checkboxes for both platforms
Team collaboration - Share via URL, export/import guides
Professional output - Print/PDF for documentation
Example: A team building both iOS and Android apps can document "Push Notification Setup" showing Xcode steps on left, Android Studio steps on right, with cross-references where they integrate with the same backend.
